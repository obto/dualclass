#### Random Dual Class

This is a D&D 5e dual-class random character generator. Everything is random - race, classes, spells, skills, backgrounds.

Since randomness is a handicap in itself, we're forgoing the typical 5e multiclassing rules. The special rules for this generator:

1. Stats are done as 5d6, take highest three. No effort is made to prioritize stats to classes (see: randomness).
2. No prerequisites are required for the second class.
3. Everything you learn at base level of your first class, you learn at base level of your second class; you get all skills and proficiencies as normal.
4. Both classes start at level 1, and levels simultaneously. So you're a 3/3 or a 15/15, but never a 7/3.
5. Proficiency bonus is based on the individual level, not the combined level. So your proficiency bonus increases to +3 at 5/5, not 3/3.
6. ASIs work the same way, except you gain it twice (once for each class). So at 4/4, you have two ASIs to work with.

Things it can do right now:
* Generate dual-class characters, levels 1-20
* Mostly keep from learning duplicate spells and skills
* Selectable splatbook inclusion

Things on its to-do list include:
* Cantrip order-of-operations fixes
* Including the rest of the splatbooks
* Slowly better interface
* Randomly selecting gear
* Calculating AC off of said gear + unarmored AC abilities
* Double-duty ASI calculations at each ASI stage
* Feats?
* Displaying climbing/swimming speeds
* Warlock invocation order-of-ops for learning spells
